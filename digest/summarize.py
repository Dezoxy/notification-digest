    """Enforce that the digest markdown carries all three required section headings.

    `run_claude` only guarantees non-empty stdout — a refusal ("I can't help
    with that"), truncated prose, or output that silently drops a section
    would otherwise pass through untouched. If that garbage reaches
    `_deliver`, every item gets stamped with the digest id and, once SMTP
    succeeds, the digest row is final: those items are lost to
    summarization forever. This check must run before anything is
    persisted, and it must raise SummarizeError on failure so the caller
    skips writing a digest row entirely -- with no row recorded, the next
    run re-selects and re-summarizes the same items instead of treating
    them as already handled.

    A plain substring check (`heading in text.lower()`) is fooled by a
    refusal that merely *mentions* the headings inline -- e.g. "I cannot
    produce ## Needs attention, ## Worth knowing, or ## Noise skipped in
    this case." contains all three substrings without a single real
    heading line. So instead this parses actual heading LINES: a line
    whose stripped form starts with exactly "## " (two hashes -- "###  "
    subgroup headings are not h2 and are ignored). Each of the three
    required sections must appear exactly once among those heading lines,
    and in the fixed relative order given by _REQUIRED_HEADINGS. Unknown
    extra h2 headings are allowed.

    Only the heading names are checked, case-insensitively -- never the
    error message includes the offending output itself, since it may
    contain scraped Telegram/X message content (see SummarizeError).

    Links are deliberately NOT validated here: a window with nothing but
    noise legitimately produces zero `[text](url)` links in "Worth
    knowing", and that is correct output, not a contract violation.

    Fenced code blocks are also excluded from heading line detection: a
    refusal can legitimately quote the required heading text inside a
    fenced block (e.g. "here's the template you asked about:\n```
    \n## Needs attention\n...") and that is not a real section -- it is
    example text sitting inside a code fence. Per CommonMark, a fence can
    be delimited by three-or-more backticks OR three-or-more tildes, and a
    fence only closes on a line starting with three-or-more of the SAME
    delimiter character that opened it -- a ``` line inside a ~~~ fence
    (or vice versa) is just fence content, not a closer. While the in-fence
    flag is set, "## " lines are not counted as headings, and the fence
    delimiter lines themselves are never counted either.

    CommonMark also requires the closing fence to be AT LEAST as long as
    the opening fence, and to contain nothing but the delimiter run plus
    trailing whitespace -- no info string is allowed on a closer (unlike
    the opener, which may carry one, e.g. ```json). So a 4-backtick opener
    is not closed by a 3-backtick line (that line is just fence content),
    and a line like "``` python" or "```extra" never closes a fence at all,
    regardless of run length, because it has non-whitespace after the
    delimiter run. This module tracks both the delimiter character and the
    opening run length to enforce this.

    Indented lines are excluded from heading and fence-delimiter detection,
    before any stripping happens: per CommonMark, an ATX heading (or a
    fence delimiter) may be indented at most 3 spaces -- a line starting
    with a tab, or with 4 or more leading spaces, is an indented code block
    instead. A refusal that pads a template with 4-space indentation (e.g.
    "    ## Needs attention") is therefore code content, not a real
    heading, and must not satisfy the contract.
