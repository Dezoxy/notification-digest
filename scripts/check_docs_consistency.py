"""Fail when documentation contradicts the tree it documents.

The mechanical half of the /docs-sync audit (.claude/skills/docs-sync/SKILL.md).
It only checks claims derivable from the repo: mirrored files, resolvable
links, indexes, ADR format, the view register and cross-referenced IDs. A green
run means "nothing provably false", not "docs are good".

Every check whose subject is missing is skipped, not failed, so a repository
adopts them as it grows: no docs index, no view register, no speaker notes and
no requirement documents still passes. What exists must be consistent.

The canonical copy lives in architecture-base (scripts/); repositories copy it
unchanged.
